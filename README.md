		  -- you can decode base on arg_xx, not a fixed one.
		  local res, data = qr:decode("/tmp/xx.png");
		  if res ~= ngx.HTTP_OK then
    		ngx.exit(ngx.HTTP_NOT_FOUND);
		  end

		  ngx.say(data);
		';

  2. if zxing is ok on you linux, that cd /opt/lua-resty-QRDecode/clib/; and make for libqrdecode.so (refer my blog mentioned [above](http://www.dcshi.com/?p=193))
  3. config [lua_package_path](http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpLuaModule#lua_package_cpath), [lua_package_cpath](http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpLuaModule#lua_package_cpath) in your nginx.
